# 🧠 Desktop Virtual Assistant

A Python-based Desktop Virtual Assistant capable of understanding and executing voice commands. This mini project acts as a personal assistant to perform tasks such as opening applications, fetching weather, telling time, searching Wikipedia, and more.

## 💡 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a basic AI assistant that can:
- Interact with the user through voice
- Perform useful desktop tasks
- Provide quick information (like weather, time, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- SpeechRecognition 🎙️
- pyttsx3 (Text to Speech) 🗣️
- PyAudio 🔊
- Wikipedia API 🌐
- Webbrowser 📎
- Datetime ⏰
- OS Module 🖥️



⚠️ **Note:** This project runs only on **Python 3.10** due to compatibility with some libraries.
## 🚀 Features

- 🔊 Voice recognition and response
- 📅 Tells current time and date
- 🌐 Searches Wikipedia and reads summary
- 🖥️ Opens desktop applications like Notepad, Browser, etc.
- 💻 Executes basic system commands
- 🔍 Searches the web

**📚 Learnings**

1.Implemented voice-based input/output using speech_recognition and pyttsx3

2.Automated simple desktop and online tasks

**🔮 Future Enhancements**

1.Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt

2..Add more app integration (e.g., email, file manager)

3..Improve natural language understanding
